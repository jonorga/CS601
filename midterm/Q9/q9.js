// What is wrong with the following code, fix any errors:
int k = 0;
const 8ball = "grilled cheese";

if (const i = 1: i <> j; {i++}) {
{
	document.getObjectById("I"d like to have tomatoes with my &{8ball} and a slice of avocado on the side, please.);
}



// SOLUTION:
const k = 5; // k doesn't have to be 5, but it needs to be greater than i for the loop to run
const eightball = "grilled cheese"; // variables cant start with a number

while (let i = 1; i < k; i++) {
	document.getObjectById(`someIdentifier${i}`).innerHTML = `I'd like to have tomatoes with my ${eightball} and a slice of avocado on the side, please.`;
}
